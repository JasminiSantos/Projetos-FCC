          <li><strong>1482</strong> - Leonardo was charged with a crime that he was later cleared from. He was so embarrassed that he moved from Florence to Milan.</li>
          <li><strong>1490</strong> - Sometime during the 1490's da Vinci began keeping notebooks full of his philosophies and beliefs. Many of these notebooks can be seen today in various museums.</li>

          <li><strong>1506</strong> - Leonardo returned to Milan to work for the French governor there. He put a hold on his art to do architect work.</li>
